# MorePingsMod 1.8.9
Pings you when customizable keywords show up in chat, by formatting the word to be fancy, and playing a ding noise.

The majority of the mod's settings can be customized by the command /morepings or via the forge configuration GUI. The different config settings and their descriptions are [listed below](https://github.com/Scribee/MorePingsMod-1.8.9#config-settings) :-)

_NOTE_: The mod does nothing in singleplayer and on servers other than hypixel.
