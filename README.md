# MorePingsMod 1.8.9
Pings you when customizable keywords show up in chat by formatting the word to be fancy, and playing a ding noise.

The majority of the mod's settings can be customized by the command /morepings or via the forge configuration GUI. The different config settings and their descriptions are [listed below](https://github.com/Scribee/MorePingsMod#config-settings) :-)

_NOTE_: This mod does nothing in singleplayer and on servers other than Hypixel, as it's made to only deal with Hypixel chat formatting.
